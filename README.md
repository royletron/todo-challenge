**The Todo Challenge** is a programming challenge to produce a 'Todo' list style application using React alongside a Reflux data store.

## How to use

First, you should clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/royletron/todo-challenge.git <yourAppName>
$ cd <yourAppName>
$ npm install
```

If you want to commit your code back to the repository, and you really should, create your own branch using.

```bash
git checkout -b <yourGithubUserId>
```

You can then commit and push as normal. In order to run your application use:

```bash
$ npm start
```

You should see a new browser tap opening and a title of "Hello World" in http://127.0.0.1:8080.

From there, you start to develop your own code in the `app` directory.

## Building

If you would like to build, when you finish coding, use `npm run build` or `npm run deploy` to build the static files.
